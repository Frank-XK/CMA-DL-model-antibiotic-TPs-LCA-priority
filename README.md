Based on the antibiotics EcoR, EnvR, HuhR, and AMR, this paper constructs a priority assessment framework for antibiotic LCR (Lifecycle Risk) using molecular graphs and fused molecular fingerprints as input. By introducing a transmembrane attention mechanism, the Cross-modal attention (MCA-DL) model is successfully developed to identify TPs (Transitional Products) with high similarity to the parent antibiotics across their entire life cycle risks. The aim is to provide a new perspective for a deeper understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and LCR prioritization, further emphasizing the necessity of focusing on the transformation products and corresponding transformation reactions that possess equal or even higher priority compared to the parent antibiotics.
